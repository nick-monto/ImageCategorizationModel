# ImageCategorizationModel
Modularized image classification model.

Just several files for image classification using Keras package. 

The files are seperated into image preprocessing (using several packages), model init, training, and test.

Each file calls on the previous in the order. So the order is preprocessing --> model init --> model training --> and model test.
